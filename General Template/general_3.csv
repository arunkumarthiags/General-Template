MRA - Review objectives and best practices,"Migration  Readiness Assessment is a critical step early in the Migration Journey to  assess readiness of customers' applications for migrating to AWS. Customers  gain critical insights regarding readiness and build a plan to close the  identified gaps. 
  The MRA also provides AWS and AWS Partners with an opportunity to build  trust and to be positioned as the preferred provider as customers expand  their adoption into the AWS Cloud.

  As part of the MRA workflow, the primary task is to review the targeted  objectives of the migration journey. Targeted objectives may include Building  an overall vision, Creating a reliable implementation roadmap, Identifying  gaps and providing corrective actions etc. 

  Reviewing the current architecture, security and governance, and preparing  for cloud adoption by creating concrete deliverables. By validating Migration  Readiness against the available best practices, customers can identify the  strengths and weaknesses of the current architecture and avoid possible  roadblocks while migrating.
